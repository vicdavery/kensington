* This application will attempt to recreate the board game Kensington.
* Kensington is a deceptively simple game. Played on a board as shown below.
* \image html Kensington_board.svg
*
* The board is not a rectilinear layout and therefore identifying nodes is
* not straightforward. Each node must be connected, by one or more edges.
* \attention
* How do I identify a node on which to place a counter?
